\title{A function for loading OTS data via HMRC's API.}
\usage{
load_ots(
  month = NULL,
  flow = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  commodity = NULL,
  sitc = NULL,
  country = NULL,
  region = NULL,
  port = NULL,
  suppression = NULL,
  join_lookup = TRUE,
  output = "tibble",
  skip_interval = 40000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{month}{The month(s) to be loaded in the form of a vector of two integers (YYYYMM), where the first element is the minimum date, and second the maximum date. Defaults to NULL (all months).}

\item{flow}{The trade flow to be loaded. Takes one ore more integers (1, 2, 3, and/or 4), where 1 is EU imports, 2 is EU exports, 3 is non-EU imports, and 4 is non-EU exports. Defaults to NULL (all flows).}

\item{commodity}{One or more HS2, HS4, HS6, or CN8 commodity codes in the form of a numeric vector. Defaults to NULL (all commodities).}

\item{sitc}{One or more SITC1, SITC2, SITC4, or SITC5 commodity codes in the form of a numeric vector. Defaults to NULL (all commodities).}

\item{country}{One or more destination or origin countries by their 2-letter ISO code. Defaults to NULL (all countries).}

\item{region}{One or more destination or origin regions. Defaults to NULL (all regions). Takes one or more of the following broad categories: "Asia and Oceania", "Eastern Europe exc EU", "European Union", "Latin America and Caribbean", "Middle East and N Africa", "North America", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Western Europe exc EU", "Western Europe exc EC", "Low Value Trade", "Stores and Provisions", and/or "Confidential Region".}

\item{port}{One or more departure or arrival ports (only available for trade with non-EU countries prior to 2021, and all trade post-2021). Defaults to NULL (all ports).}

\item{suppression}{One or more suppression codes. Takes one or more integers between 1 and 5 (see HMRC API guidance for information). Defaults to NULL (all available results).}

\item{join_lookup}{A logical value indicating whether results should be joined with lookups from the API. Defaults to TRUE. Setting to FALSE will return a smaller but less human-readable dataframe containing only codes.}

\item{output}{A character specifying if a tibble ("tibble") or dataframe ("df") should be returned. Defaults to "tibble".}

\item{skip_interval}{Passed to load_custom(). A non-negative integer value showing the skip interval for paginated results. Defaults to 40,000 rows.}

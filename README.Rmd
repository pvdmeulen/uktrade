The goal of `uktrade` is to provide convenient wrapper functions for analysing HMRC data in R.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of `uktrade` from this GitHub repository using `remotes`:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pvdmeulen/uktrade")
```
## HMRC data

Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) is the UK's customs authority and a non-ministerial department of the United Kingdom Government. Data on UK trade is available on their [uktradeinfo.com](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/) website, which is collected through a combination of customs declarations and Intrastat surveys (in the case of [some EU trade](https://www.gov.uk/intrastat)).

In the beginning of 2021, the [uktradeinfo.com](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/) website was updated. This update also introduced an Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing bulk trade (and trader) data. For smaller trade data extracts (< 30,000 rows), the [online tool](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/trade-data/) may be sufficient.

## This package

This package contains four functions:

* `load_ots()`: a function for loading Overseas Trade Statistics data
* `load_rts()`: a function for loading Regional Trade Statistics data
* `load_trader()`: a function for loading trader data
* `load_custom()`: a function for loading a custom URL

All of these functions will output a `dataframe` object with the desired data, and are able to keep track of paginated results (in batches of 30,000 rows) as well as the API request limit of 60 requests per minute.

## Example

This example uses the `load_custom()` function to replicate the example given in the [API documentation](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/api-documentation/) for finding all traders that exported ‘Live horses (excl. pure-bred for breeding)’ from the ‘CB8’ post code in 2019:

```{r load_custom example, }
library(uktrade)

data <- load_custom(endpoint = "Commodity", custom_search = "?$filter=Hs6Code eq '010129'&$expand=Exports($filter=MonthId ge 201901 and MonthId le 201912 and startswith(Trader/PostCode, 'CB8'); $expand=Trader)")

head(data)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
